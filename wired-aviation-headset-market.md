<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wired Aviation Headset Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Noise Reduction (PNR) Headsets</li><li>Active Noise Reduction (ANR) Headsets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wired aviation headset market comprises two primary types: Passive Noise Reduction (PNR) and Active Noise Reduction (ANR) headsets. PNR headsets rely on physical barriers, such as padded ear cups, to block out ambient noise, providing basic sound isolation. In contrast, ANR headsets utilize electronic components to actively counteract external sounds by generating sound waves that cancel out noise. Both types enhance pilot communication and overall comfort in noisy environments, but ANR headsets typically offer superior noise reduction technology.</p></p>
