<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stem Cell Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autologous</li><li>Allogeneic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stem cell therapy is categorized into two main market types: autologous and allogeneic. Autologous stem cell therapy uses cells derived from the patient's own body, minimizing the risk of immune rejection and ensuring better compatibility. This approach is often utilized in personal treatments, such as for certain cancers. In contrast, allogeneic stem cell therapy involves cells obtained from a donor, which can provide broader application possibilities for diseases but carries higher risks of complications and immune response.</p></p>
