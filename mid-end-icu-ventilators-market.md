<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mid end ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Mid-end ICU ventilators market is categorized into two primary types: invasive and non-invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves the placement of an artificial airway through intubation, allowing for precise control of breathing in critically ill patients. Non-invasive ventilation, on the other hand, utilizes face masks or nasal devices to assist with breathing without the need for intubation, making it less traumatic for patients. Both types are essential for managing respiratory failure and supporting patient recovery in intensive care settings.</p></p>
