<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microneedle Patch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dissolving Type</li><li>Insoluble Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The microneedle patch market consists of two main types: dissolving and insoluble. Dissolving microneedles are made from biocompatible materials that dissolve upon contact with the skin, releasing the drug directly into the bloodstream. This type is often favored for its ease of use and reduced risk of infection. Insoluble microneedles, on the other hand, remain intact after application and can deliver drugs through traditional means, offering versatility for various applications. Both types enhance transdermal drug delivery efficiency.</p></p>
