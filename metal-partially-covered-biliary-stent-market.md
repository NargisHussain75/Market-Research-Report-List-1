<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Partially Covered Biliary Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non Absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metal partially covered biliary stent market is divided into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable stents. Absorbable stents are designed to gradually dissolve over time, promoting natural tissue healing while providing temporary support for bile flow. In contrast, non-absorbable stents remain permanently in the body, providing ongoing relief from biliary obstructions. The choice between these stent types depends on the patientâ€™s condition, duration of treatment needed, and potential risks associated with longer-term stenting.</p></p>
