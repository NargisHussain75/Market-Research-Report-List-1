<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tumor-Specific Antigen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coding Region</li><li>Non-Coding Region</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Tumor-Specific Antigen (TSA) market encompasses two main types: coding region and non-coding region antigens. Coding region TSAs are derived from genes that produce mutant proteins specific to tumors, facilitating targeted immune responses. In contrast, non-coding region TSAs stem from RNA molecules, such as long non-coding RNAs, that play a role in tumorigenesis but do not encode proteins. Both types contribute significantly to cancer immunotherapy, diagnostics, and personalized medicine, enhancing treatment strategies tailored to individual tumors.</p></p>
