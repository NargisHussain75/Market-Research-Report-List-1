<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Monorail System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straddle Type</li><li>Suspended Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The monorail system market can be categorized into two main types: straddle type and suspended type. Straddle-type monorails run on an elevated track, allowing vehicles to straddle the guideway, which is useful in dense urban areas to minimize land use. In contrast, suspended-type monorails hang from a track overhead, primarily designed for scenic or amusement applications, offering a unique travel experience. Both types contribute to efficient urban transportation and reduce traffic congestion while providing varying levels of aesthetic appeal and operational functionality.</p></p>
