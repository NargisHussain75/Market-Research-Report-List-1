<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Generation Control Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Turbine-Governor Control (TGC)</li><li>Load-Frequency Control (LFC)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic Generation Control (AGC) encompasses various market types that manage power system stability. Turbine-Governor Control (TGC) focuses on regulating individual turbine performance to respond to frequency changes, ensuring immediate adjustments in generation. Load-Frequency Control (LFC), on the other hand, coordinates larger grid-level frequency and load balance by adjusting the output of multiple generators based on aggregate system demand. Both play vital roles in maintaining grid reliability and preventing frequency deviations in power systems.</p></p>
