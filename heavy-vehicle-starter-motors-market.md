<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy Vehicle Starter Motors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial (Sliding Armature)</li><li>Coaxial (Sliding Gear)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy vehicle starter motors market features primarily two types: axial (sliding armature) and coaxial (sliding gear) designs. Axial starter motors use a sliding armature that moves along the axis to engage the flywheel, providing efficient torque and compactness. In contrast, coaxial starter motors employ a sliding gear mechanism, allowing for direct engagement with the flywheel while maintaining a smaller overall size. Both types are essential for reliable engine cranking in heavy vehicles, catering to diverse applications and performance requirements.</p></p>
