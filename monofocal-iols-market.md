<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Monofocal IOLs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aspheric Monofocal IOLs</li><li>Spheric Monofocal IOLs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Monofocal intraocular lenses (IOLs) are designed to provide clear vision at a single distance, typically used after cataract surgery. The market splits into two types: aspheric and spheric monofocal IOLs. Aspheric monofocal IOLs feature a modified shape that enhances contrast sensitivity and reduces spherical aberrations, leading to improved visual acuity, especially in low-light conditions. In contrast, spheric monofocal IOLs have a uniform curvature, offering straightforward optical performance but may not correct spherical aberrations as effectively. Both types cater to different patient needs in vision correction.</p></p>
